        <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2></br>
        <h3 id="sson">Single Statement of Need</h3>
        <p>Aim of our project is to create a Dragon Boat racing game, based on the real Dragon Boat Challenge held in York.
          The game shall be enjoyable and playable on a low spec computer.</p>
        <h3 id="eliciting">How the requirement were elicited</h3>
        <p>In order to elicit requirements, we first researched how best to go about doing and presenting these as well as the point of requirements
          engineering in a project. Requirements engineering is the process of discerning what the stakeholders want from the product, then presenting
          it in a way which is readable and makes the set of requirements processable [1]. According to Sommerville [2], open interviews are often not
          an ideal way to conduct research, so we elected to use a mostly closed-format interview in order to gather our initial set of user requirements.
          Our initial interview was with our main stakeholder, Dr. Javier Cámara, and was used to gather basic information about the system we were to implement.</p>
        <p>Our other stakeholder, the Communications Office at the University of York, was also represented by our main stakeholder in this
          specific instance as they are in contact with them.  We had to do very little negotiation between stakeholders to decide on final
          requirements because of a clean overlap in stakeholder interests.  Both stakeholders want a product that will be playable and enjoyable,
          with the main stakeholder wanting it marketable additionally and the other stakeholder wanting it to be usable in promotional activities.
          The majority of negotiation was between our team and the stakeholder to reach a compromise between what is possible given the allotted
          resources and what the desired product is.</p>
        <h3 id="req-representation">Representation format</h3>
        <p>After completing the interview, we had to find a way to present them that would be understandable and concise.  There are four main ways to
          present requirements - using natural language sentences, structured natural language, graphically  using UML or diagrams, or mathematically [3].
          User requirements should be written in a way that describes what the functional and non-functional requirements mean in an understandable way,
           so we wrote our requirements in a structured natural language format. This format involves writing the requirements using a standardised
           template so that each requirement is unambiguous and clear, one of the main advantages of this format over natural language sentences.
           Whilst it is less unambiguous than pure mathematical notation, it is often far easier for a customer to understand and means they are more
          likely to accept the set of requirements.</p>

        <h3>User Requirements </h3>
        <p>Our client has asked us to produce a game about Dragon Boat racing.  The player will control a boat over three heats and a final race, using
          the keyboard and mouse to dodge obstacles which may slow them down or damage their craft.  Between these races, the player can upgrade their boat
          if they have the required currency to do so, which will give them a competitive advantage.  The player will win if they have the fastest time, place
          if they are second or third fastest, or lose otherwise.</p>

        <h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2></br>
        <p>We used UML (Unified Modeling Language), which a standardized and most-used modeling language developed to help system and software developers
           for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. UML uses mostly graphical notations to express
           the design of software projects, which, we decided, is the most straightforward way to communicate detailed information about the architecture
           of our game.</p>
        <h3 id="abstract">Abstract Architecture</h3>
        <p>We created a set of diagrams – an Entity-Component-Systems model, Sequence diagram and a State diagram - in order to represent the abstract
          architecture of the game. For the Entity-Component-Systems model and Sequence diagram we used PlantUML tool - an open-source tool that allows
          users to create UML diagrams from a plain text language. As for the State diagram, we chose to use Lucidchart. It is a web-based platform allowing
          users to collaborate on drawing, revising and sharing charts and diagrams.</p>

        <h2 id="method">Method Selection and Planning</h2></br>
        <h3>Software Engineering Methods</h3>
        <p>As a team, we have opted to follow an agile development methodology, specifically using a cross of the Scrum and Kanban frameworks.
          The Agile methodology is an evolution of incremental development, a method involving breaking down a problem into many smaller steps,
          and takes it a step further by encouraging adaptive planning and flexibility in development.</p>
          <p>The <b>Scrum</b> framework is designed for smaller teams,
           making it perfect for us. Goals are broken down into iterations which should take a short amount of time, and are completed within a set
           amount of time known as a sprint. By using small sprints and defining small goals development can easily react to changes in requirements
           or specifications, as well as being easier on the team since there are no massive goals to tackle. We have modified the Scrum framework slightly,
          reducing the length of a sprint to one week to represent the complexity of the project.</p>
          <p><b>Kanban</b> is a method to manage workloads by splitting the workload into smaller tasks that anybody can complete.  It allows for a more visual
            representation of what work needs to be completed, what is in progress, and what has been finished, using a Kanban board.  These boards are
            designed based on the context of development and may range from a simple todo, in progress, completed board to boards that also have stories,
            restrictions, and other more complex features.  Any developer can take a job from the todo section of the list and commence work on it, moving
            it through any intermediate stages before it is finally completed.</p>
          <h3>Collaboration and Development Tools</h3>
          <p>One of our primary tools in development is <b>Git</b>, a distributed version-control system.  Git allows for multiple programmers to work on the same
            project by creating branches, putting their changes to the code into those branches, then merging them back into the main branch.  Additionally,
            branches can be created for any size of change so are ideal for Scrum where changes are very small.  Changes can be committed to the repository
            in 30 seconds and, provided that the same code hasn’t changed in the master branch, merged just as easily.  Additionally, if some code changes need
            to be undone Git allows the user to simply reset to an earlier version of the code, uniquely identified by a hash value.</p>
          <p>Other tools exist that fulfill a similar purpose, such as Apache Subversion or Mercurial, both version control tools.  Whilst equally feature
            complete, providing branches and full versioning, Git was chosen as it is the most familiar tool to members of the team and most commonplace.
            Additionally, if another version control software was selected, we would have to use a different repository hosting website as GitHub, for example,
            only supports Git repositories.</p>
          <p><b>GitHub</b> is another tool we are using in our development process.  GitHub is a website that provides repository hosting for Git, changing the
            commit cycle such that you can also push your commits to the server, where they can be shared with other developers.  Other developers can then
            fetch the remote branches and do their own work on them.  GitHub additionally provides tools such as Continuous Integration through
            GitHub Actions and project management through GitHub Projects.</p>
          <p><b>Github Projects</b> is a kanban board-style todo list allowing for the creation of boards and cards to go on those boards, which all developers can
            then access and modify.  This is ideal for our chosen development methodology as it allows for tasks to be broken down into smaller parts and put
            on a board where anyone can pick tasks, develop them, then move the task to the “completed” board.  Although lacking in some management features
            and formatting, it is good enough for our purposes, which is using it in a Scrum-style workflow.  Other options include websites such as Trello,
            which is similar to Projects but with more features such as colour coding and labelling, however we don’t need the additional features and having
            everything in one place is far more convenient.</p>
          <p>There are many alternatives to GitHub, providing the git repository hosting service.  One such alternative is BitBucket, which provides an almost
            identical interface, as well as integration with Trello and Jira to provide features similar to GitHub projects.  In the end, we chose GitHub as it
            is the most widely used repository hosting service in the world, and has all the features that we need.</p>
          <p>Additionally, as we need to create documentation for our entire source, we will be using <b>Javadoc</b> to generate HTML documentation files which we
            can easily transfer to our project website.  Javadoc reads through Java source files and generates documentation based on the method names and
            Javadoc-style comments that accompany them.  Other solutions include Doxygen or Sphinx however these tools are primarily for C++ and Python
            respectively, where Javadoc is designed specifically for use with Java.</p>
          <p><b>Google Drive</b> is a cloud-based storage that provides 15GB or storage for free and also comes with a suite of office tools including Docs
            (word processor), Sheets (alternative to MS Excel) and Slides (alternative to MS PowerPoint). One of the main advantages of Google Drive is the
            ability to share documents and make edits in real-time, providing an easy way to collaborate within the team. There are many alternatives to Google
            Docs such as Dropbox, OneDrive and Sync. However, Google Drive is the most common choice and also most familiar to all members of the team.</p>
          <p><b>Discord</b> is a voice and text communication platform targeted mostly at the gaming community. It provides multiple useful features such as
            the ability to create a private server and channels for different uses within it. In our example, we have a channel for design and risk ideas,
            where team members can post and discuss their ideas and decisions. Discord allows sharing media files and the screen and is easy to use. Other
            communication platforms exist, such as Zoom, which we also use for our weekly meetings as a project requirement, or Slack. However, most of the
             members are most comfortable with using Discord.</p>
          <p>For creating diagrams we chose to use <b>PlantUML</b> - an open-source tool that allows users to create UML diagrams from a plain text language
            - and <b>Lucidchart</b> which is a web-based platform allowing users to collaborate on drawing, revising and sharing charts and diagrams. Both
            tools are relatively easy to use and access which is the main advantage over other alternatives.</p>

          <li>Aleksas Kliska: -</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Approach to team organization:</p>
        <p>We tried to divide responsibilities evenly between all members of the team and let everyone contribute to the project.  We mostly focused
          on 1-2 deliverables at a time, using the Assessment brief to identify all the relevant information and details that must be included in each
          deliverable. Since we chose Scrum as our development framework, all tasks were done in small, week-long sprints. During the sprint, responsible
          team members worked on their specific tasks, while others gathered information relevant to the project. After each sprint we had a weekly meeting
          where we discussed what has been done and what is yet to be completed as well as assigned new tasks.<p>
        <p>Additionally, we had our own Discord server where members could ask questions or discuss their tasks anytime. It allowed each member of the team
          to have a clear understanding of the progress, decisions, project schedule and be able to share their own ideas.<p>
        <p>Whenever any important decisions or changes to the project plan were made, we went back to the completed deliverables and made edits in order
          to ensure that all deliverables are up to date.</p>
        <p>This method is appropriate for our team and the project as it is perfect for small teams and provides everyone with an opportunity to contribute and stay informed about all decisions made within the team. In addition, it allows a certain degree of flexibility,  as the whole project is divided into small tasks that can be done by any member of the team in case if someone is sick or unwilling to participate. Additionally, our method allows us to react to changes and make new decisions without complications.</p>

        <h3>How the plan evolved</h3>
        <p>Start dates of some tasks were shifted and the overall progress of the project was delayed due to poor communication between the team members,
          illnesses and inactivity of some members. As a result, we started working on the implementation much later than planned.</p>
        <p>We originally planned to present our product requirements in tabular form. In the end, we decided to write them in a structured natural language
          format in order to present requirements, associated with them risks and alternatives in a more understandable way. It caused a delay and difficulty
           moving on to other sections. Most of the other deliverables were completed on time.</p>

        </br>
        <h3 id="risk-intro">Introduction and justification</h3>
        <p>In order to identify possible risks, we first defined our project objectives. Our main goal was to build a boat racing game that would
          satisfy all the requirements of the customer, be playable and enjoyable. We then reviewed the requirements, including user, functional and
          nonfunctional requirements, and went through our project plan to determine all possible factors that can affect the quality of the final product.</p>
        <p>For documentation purposes we decided to organize possible risks in tabular format. We also divided all risks in three categories: “Project”,
          “Product” and “Business”. “Project” category is assigned to the risks that might affect our project schedule and progressing speed. “Product” category
          is for the risks that may potentially affect the quality of the game, for example, any hardware or software issues. As for “Business”, this
          category is assigned to the risks that may affect the success of our product in the market.</p>
        <p>In addition, we assigned likelihood and severity scores to each risk. For both likelihood and severity measurement we used a scale of “low”,
          “medium” and “high” which is easy to understand and intuitive.</p>
        <p>Potential risks have been identified by the whole project team, as all members of the team were involved. Any potential risk suggested
          by any member was recorded and analysed. More specific/technical issues have also been assigned to specific team members that are working on
          related parts of the project. If a new potential risk is found by a member in the future, it will be posted in the Discord dedicated channel,
          then discussed and added to the table.</p>
