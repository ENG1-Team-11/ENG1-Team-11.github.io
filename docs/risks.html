      </br>
      <h3 id="risk-intro">Introduction and justification</h3>
      <p>In order to identify possible risks, we first defined our project objectives. Our main goal was to build a boat racing game that would
        satisfy all the requirements of the customer, be playable and enjoyable. We then reviewed the requirements, including user, functional and
        nonfunctional requirements, and went through our project plan to determine all possible factors that can affect the quality of the final product.</p>
      <p>For documentation purposes we decided to organize possible risks in tabular format. We also divided all risks in three categories: “Project”,
        “Product” and “Business”. “Project” category is assigned to the risks that might affect our project schedule and progressing speed. “Product” category
        is for the risks that may potentially affect the quality of the game, for example, any hardware or software issues. As for “Business”, this
        category is assigned to the risks that may affect the success of our product in the market, in our case - success of using our game for promotional
        activities organized by The University of York Communications Office.</p>
      <p>In addition, we assigned likelihood and severity scores to each risk. For both likelihood and severity measurement we used a scale of “low”,
        “medium” and “high” which is easy to understand and intuitive.</p>
      <p>Potential risks have been identified by the whole project team, as all members of the team were involved. Any potential risk suggested
        by any member was recorded and analysed. More specific/technical issues have also been assigned to specific team members that are working on
        related parts of the project. If a new potential risk is found by a member in the future, it will be posted in the Discord dedicated channel,
        then discussed and added to the table.</p>
