        <!-- Aboit the actual Dragon Race in York -->

        <h2>China's Dragon Boat Festival</h2>
        <p>Dragon boat racing is said to originate from the legend of people paddling out on boats to seek the body
          of patriotic poet Qu Yuan (343–278 BC), who drowned himself in a River. Dragon boat racing is the most important
          activity during the Dragon Boat Festival. The wooden boats are shaped and decorated in the form of a Chinese dragon.
          The boat size varies by region, generally it is about 20–35 meters in length and needs 30–60 people to paddle it. During
          the races, dragon boat teams paddle harmoniously and hurriedly, accompanied by the sound of beating drums.
          It is said that the winning team will have good luck and a happy life in the following year.</p>

        <h2>York Dragon Boat Race</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Since 2003, York has its own annual Dragon Boat Challenge on the River Ouse, on a course from Scarborough
          Bridge to Lendal Bridge. Every year, many teams compete to be the fastest dragon on the river and win the gold medal.
          York Rotary Club have been running a Dragon Boat Challenge on the River Ouse for 14 years and raised over £940,000
          for 170 York and Yorkshire charities.</p>
